v1.0.0.20. Added support for MFT record size of 4096 bytes.

v1.0.0.19. Fixed a unicode related bug that caused the last character to be incorrect when that character was of 2 bytes.

v1.0.0.18. Added unicode support.

v1.0.0.17. Another major improvement in the identification of the current attribute. 

v1.0.0.16. Fixed bug that caused $UsnJrnl? to sometimes be incorrectly displayed in the lf_TextInformation? column. 

v1.0.0.15. Fixed CurrentAttribute? when $UsnJrnl? is writing zeros to align the initialized data to page boundary. Added reference to LogFile?_INDX.csv in column lf_TextInformation? where due. Corrected CurrentAttribute? for both UpdateFileNameRoot? and UpdateFileNameAllocation?, and changed their timestamps from being FN to SI. Changed interpreted meaning of op code 1000 = ResetAllocation?, and 1100 = ResetRoot?. 

v1.0.0.14. More fixes to the OpenNonresidentAttribute?. Now current attribute is displayed even more detailed like this: $DATA:$SDS, $INDEX_ALLOCATION:$I30, $INDEX_ALLOCATION:$O. Added decode information for DeleteAttribute? operations. Fixed a bug that caused certain corrupted values to be displayed as decoded UsnJrnl? record values. Added more mapping to filename for transactions. Some minor adjustments on the logic/prediction of reference numbers. Added new column for namespace, and real reference. The new column lf_RealMFTReference facilitated the addition of a lot more decode output into the core LogFile? csv. v1.0.0.13.

Fixed mapping of MFT ref for SetIndexEntryVcnAllocation? operations. Added more decoding to UpdateNonResidentValue? operations. Added decode of operation code 1000, which is a clearing of an index. Specifically the redo operation is just a reset, while the undo operation is a complete INDX record (without header) of the original content. With this information it is now possible to start building a history of changes to directory content/indexes. 

v1.0.0.12. Fixed a new bug in the reconstruction of dataruns that was introduced in previous version. 

v1.0.0.11. Implemented GUI with configurable options, progressbar etc. Fixed a lot of issues when resolving MFT references. Fixed bug that incorrectly updated CurrentAttribute? when redo operation was UpdateResidentValue?. Added decoding of OpenNonresidentAttribute?. Added 3 columns in output: TextInformation?, RedoChunkSize? and UndoChunkSize?. Added more updating of CurrentAttribute?. Using undo operations to aid in interpreting data. Changed default separator to "|" to minimize chances for hitting filenames that needed to be changed. Added importing to db of the resolved dataruns csv. Added option to import csv of decoded MFT (mft2csv), and joining file paths. Added option to choose timestamp format and precision, with example displayed in gui. Option to split extra timestamps into separate csv (will slow down processing!). 

v1.0.0.5. Added missing reparse types. Added filtering on attribute type for index decoding ($FILE_NAME -> $I30). Removed program exit when import of indx csv failed. Fixed serious bug when loading the sqlite3 dll. The dll is now included. Added more error checking with the sqlite3 stuff.
